USE EFFECT HOOK:

	upon the action in all functional components monitoring the impact or side effects can be done using use effect  hook 


lets say we have 5 components:
as c1...c5

to overcome this in terms of efficiency we are using hooks

this is not efficient, to make it efficient we have an exclusive hook called useContext()

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


creating 4 components:
1 - app
2 - container
3 - users
4 - user


without following hierarchy passing state from one component from one component using the hook:
	important hings:
		1)create context
		2)use context

in the given example create context will be in the app component and used in user component


after our action monitoring or happening in the file os possible using use effect hook
